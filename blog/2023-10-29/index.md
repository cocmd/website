## TLDR

This is a standard DBT project [example data project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) "Getting Started", 
**long long long list of instructions on how to setup and run everything. familiar right?**

## Setting the stage

Data teams are instrumental in data-driven organizations. 

A significant aspect of their role involves conveying to others how to manage data operations and services.


A key facet of their responsibilities entails effectively imparting knowledge on managing data operations and services to others. This often takes the form of 
- extensive how-to guides, 
- documentation, 
- archived Slack conversations, 
- and the sharing of internal knowledge. 
They guide teams on various tasks, such as setting up machines for data operations, conducting queries, establishing connections, and more.


## The Challenges Data Teams Face


1. **Complex Toolchains:** Data professionals often use a range of tools for data collection, data processing, and analysis. Coordinating these tools and ensuring their proper setup can be a daunting task.

2. **Onboarding:** New members joining the data team need to quickly adapt to the toolchains and workflows. A smooth onboarding process is crucial for their productivity.

3. **Repetitive Tasks:** Data teams frequently deal with repetitive tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and report generation. Automating these tasks can save valuable time.

4. **Collaboration:** Effective collaboration within the data team and across departments is essential for sharing insights and results. This requires streamlined processes for sharing code, data, and documentation.
