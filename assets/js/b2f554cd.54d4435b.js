This often takes the form of \\n- extensive how-to guides, \\n- documentation, \\n- archived Slack conversations, \\n- and the sharing of internal knowledge. \\nThey guide teams on various tasks, such as setting up machines for data operations, conducting queries, establishing connections, and more.\\n\\n\\n## The Challenges Data Teams Face\\n\\n\\n1. **Complex Toolchains:** Data professionals often use a range of tools for data collection, data processing, and analysis. Coordinating these tools and ensuring their proper setup can be a daunting task.\\n\\n2. **Onboarding:** New members joining the data team need to quickly adapt to the toolchains and workflows. A smooth onboarding process is crucial for their productivity.\\n\\n3. **Repetitive Tasks:** Data teams frequently deal with repetitive tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and report generation. Automating these tasks can save valuable time.\\n\\n4. **Collaboration:** Effective collaboration within the data team and across departments is essential for sharing insights and results. This requires streamlined processes for sharing code, data, and documentation.\\n\\n## How CoCMD Can Help\\n\\nCoCMD offers a simple and open command-line interface to address these challenges. Here\'s how data teams can benefit:\\n\\n### Streamlined Toolchain Setup\\n\\nCoCMD can automate the setup of the various tools and packages needed by data teams. With a single command, team members can have their development environments configured consistently.\\n\\n### Effortless Onboarding\\n\\nNew team members can be onboarded seamlessly using CoCMD. By following predefined onboarding playbooks, they can quickly become productive, eliminating the time-consuming process of manual setup and configuration.\\n\\n### Automation of Repetitive Tasks\\n\\nCoCMD allows data teams to create playbooks for automating repetitive data-related tasks. Whether it\'s data preprocessing, model training, or report generation, these tasks can be turned into repeatable, one-click processes.\\n\\n### Enhanced Collaboration\\n\\nCoCMD playbooks and routines can be easily shared within the team and with other departments. This ensures that everyone is using the same tools and processes, leading to improved collaboration and consistent results.\\n\\n## Getting Started with CoCMD for Data Teams\\n\\nTo get started with CoCMD for your data team, follow these simple steps:\\n\\n1. **Install CoCMD:** If you haven\'t already, install CoCMD using the installation command provided on the [CoCMD website](https://cocmd.org).\\n\\n2. **Select Data Packages:** Choose the data-related packages you need from the CoCMD-Hub, which includes packages for data analysis tools, libraries, and more.\\nFind in the hub what you need\\nhttps://cocmd.org/docs/packages/from_hub/\\nor write your own https://cocmd.org/docs/intro\\n\\n3. **Create Data Playbooks:** Develop playbooks and routines specific to your data tasks. These can include data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and report generation.\\n\\n4. **Share with Your Team:** Share your playbooks with your data team, making it easy for everyone to access and use them.\\n\\nWith CoCMD, data teams can deliver 10 times more effectively, providing insights and solutions to the rest of the organization faster and with greater consistency:\\n- great dev experience with cocmd cli\\n- private and secure\\n- re-use community knowledge\\n- automatic Docs generation\\n- automatic notifications system\\n- automatic recommendation system\\n- ready distributions to all operating systems\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vhvbx12f5furrb574d7.png)\\n\\nVisit the [CoCMD website](https://cocmd.org) to learn more about CoCMD and how it can revolutionize your data team\'s processes.\\n\\nContact the CoCMD team at mzsrtgzr2@gmail.com for any questions or assistance."},{"id":"new-opensource","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/new-opensource","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-10-18/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-18/index.md","title":"New opensource to replace long \\"Getting Started\\"s forever","description":"Do you find long readmes/wikis with complicated setup instructions frustrating?","date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"}],"readingTime":2.125,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Roth","title":"CoCMD","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosherot/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEh7IGVERPRJg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1516494237131?e=1704326400&v=beta&t=OPIydfwtlpmVSOKhxNvBZWj6-wiyDC4mCJHNKRp42PU","key":"moshe"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"new-opensource","title":"New opensource to replace long \\"Getting Started\\"s forever","authors":["moshe"],"tags":["opensource","productivity"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Data teams can deliver 10x better to the rest of us","permalink":"/blog/for-data-teams"}},"content":"## Do you find long readmes/wikis with complicated setup instructions frustrating? \\n\\nSo Do I :)\\n\\nInstead of writing down long instructions with prerequisites, installation command, configuration changes and all this with operation system variations notes - let\'s create an amazing experience for the people who needs the software you created. No one cares about the \\"steps\\" along the way, just make it happen.\\n\\nSo I created **[CoCMD](https://cocmd.org)**. A simple and open cli app to make the onboarding and playbooks experience amazing.\\n\\n\\n\\n### How does it look?\\n\\nLet\'s take for example our [Kubernetes package](https://cocmd.org/docs/packages/from_hub/k8s/).\\nI created several onboarding and playbooks that can be useful.\\n\\n\\n![Image description](./automations.png)\\n\\n\\n### Showcase\\nIt\'s important to talk about specific \\"stories\\" where the benefit of using CoCMD is obvious.\\n\\n#### Project Onboarding\\n\\nOnboarding new hires is a very important process in any company. It\'s the first impression that the new hire gets from the company and it\'s the first impression that the company gets from the new hire. It\'s also a very important process for the new hire to get to know the company and the people in it.\\n\\nRead how to do it with CoCMD [Here](https://cocmd.org/docs/showcase/onboarding)\\n\\n#### Playbooks \\n\\nUsually, every team has a set of routines and procedures that are executed on a regular basis.\\nThis can also be called \\"playbooks\\" or \\"runbooks\\". \\n\\nCoCMD can help you automate these routines and make them available to your team.\\n\\nRead how to do it with CoCMD [Here](https://cocmd.org/docs/showcase/routines)\\n\\n\\n#### Codebase CMDOps\\nAny project can have CMDOps (Command Line Operations).
