## Newcomers onboarding

This is going to help you to get started with the project.

1. Install cocmd [Getting Started](/docs/intro)
2. install and Run the Contributors onboarding packages:

```bash
cocmd install https://github.com/cocmd/cocmd
cocmd run cocmd.contrib-onboarding

```

it's going to:
- install git
- install rust
- install node
- clone all Cocmd repos
- build the website
- build cocmd cli
- open vscode with all the repos

Thank you for your help! 🙏🙏🙏
